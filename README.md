## Overview

**GitHub Mutuals** is a modern web app that helps you discover which GitHub users you follow also follow you back. Search by username (no login required) or sign in with GitHub for more accurate results and higher API limits. Only signed-in users' searches are optionally saved to Firestore with minimal fields; guest searches are not logged.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication

- Sign in with GitHub (OAuth) for higher API rate limits during sign-in (GitHub provider tokens are kept in memory)
- Or search by any public GitHub username without logging in

### 🔍 Search & Analysis

- Fetches both `followers` and `following` lists for a username
- Compares and displays:
  - ✅ **Mutual followers** (users you follow who follow you back)
  - ❌ **Not following back** (users you follow who don't follow you back)
- Handles large lists with pagination ("Show More")
- Loading spinners and error messages for invalid usernames, rate limits, etc.

### 📦 Data Persistence

- Every search is saved to Firebase Firestore with:
  - `username` (searched)
  - `timestamp`
  - `userId` (if signed in)
  - `userAgent`, `referrer` (for analytics)

### 🧑‍🎨 UI/UX

- Responsive, modern design with Tailwind CSS
- List view with avatars, usernames, and profile links
- Export results to CSV or clipboard
- Privacy policy and data collection notice

## ⏳ API Rate Limits & Considerations

- **GitHub REST API rate limits:**
  - Unauthenticated: **60 requests/hour**
  - Authenticated: **5,000 requests/hour**
- You can only check "who follows you" for other users if you are logged in as them (GitHub API limitation)
